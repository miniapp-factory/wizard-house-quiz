A cute vector illustration of a serpent mascot. The serpent is shown in a friendly, stylized style with a green body, subtle scales, and a sly, smiling face. The background is a soft pastel gradient from light teal to light green, creating a mysterious yet approachable vibe. The serpent curls around a simple curved base, with its tail playfully curled, giving a sense of cunning and charm. The illustration should be colorful, with clean lines and a slightly whimsical touch, suitable for a Hogwarts house mascot.
